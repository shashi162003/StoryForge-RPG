# StoryForge RPG üöÄ

**A real-time, AI-powered, collaborative storytelling game where players shape the narrative together.**

StoryForge RPG is a full-stack MERN application that allows a group of friends to join a virtual room and participate in a role-playing adventure. An AI Dungeon Master (powered by OpenAI's GPT models) generates the world, narrates events, and reacts to player actions, creating a unique, procedurally generated story every time. The experience is enhanced with AI-generated images, character stats, and a polished, real-time UI.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **AI Dungeon Master:** Utilizes GPT-3.5/4 to generate dynamic story content, NPCs, and outcomes.
* **Real-time Multiplayer:** Players in the same room see story updates instantly via WebSockets (Socket.IO).
* **Comprehensive Authentication:**
    * Local user registration with OTP email verification.
    * Secure JWT-based sessions using `httpOnly` cookies.
    * Social logins with Google and GitHub.
* **Dynamic Image Generation:** Periodically illustrates key story moments with AI-generated images (Stability AI).
* **Themed Adventures (World Seeding):** Choose a genre like 'High Fantasy' or 'Cyberpunk Noir' to set the tone of the story.
* **Character Sheets & Attributes:** Players have characters with stats (Strength, Wits, Charisma) that the AI considers during actions.
* **Secret Actions ("Whisper to DM"):** Players can take private actions that only they and the AI know the outcome of.
* **Persistent NPC Memory:** A dedicated AI-managed memory helps the DM remember key characters for better story consistency.
* **Polished UI/UX:**
    * A playful, "skribbl.io"-inspired theme.
    * Light/Dark mode support.
    * Smooth animations with Framer Motion.
    * Optional ambient background sound.
